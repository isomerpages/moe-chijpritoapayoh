_Simple in virtue. Steadfast in duty._

Living the school’s mission, all Primary 2 students displayed simplicity in their virtues in life and steadfast in their duty towards keeping their school environment clean. They embarked on the Happy Restroom Programme as part of their Values in Action activity in Term 2. The girls displayed our IJ values of Courage, Humility, Respect, Integrity, Steadfastness and Thoughtfulness remarkably during the activity.

The activity was given birth to with the hope of instilling responsibility in students in keeping the school restrooms clean and a happy place to visit daily.  Though the Primary 2 students are young children, it was heartwarming to note that all of them agreed unanimously that keeping the restrooms clean is not the responsibility of the cleaners but also theirs, the users! Our girls recognized that all users are to respect and be thoughtful towards the environment, the cleaners and the next users. 

Every class was assigned a restroom and the students decided on a theme to decorate and make the restrooms vibrant and beautiful. Our little ambassadors were extremely enthusiastic and dived straight down to business. They worked in groups within each class and designed posters or brought decorative items for the restrooms based on their themes.

Besides displaying the values of respect and thoughtfulness during the activity, our girls displayed courage, humility, integrity and steadfastness. They were highly engaged in decorating their assigned restrooms and were enthusiastic to showcase their master pieces to the school.

The students’ wonderful work was proudly put up in the respective restrooms much to the pride of the girls and teachers! The happy restrooms were well-received by the school population and the posters served as excellent reminders for users.
