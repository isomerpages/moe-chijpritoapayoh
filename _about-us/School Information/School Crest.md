Our school crest is red with a silver band edged in gold.  
On its right is the Gospel with a silver rosary.  
On its left, a Distaff and a Spindle.  
The Shield, topped by a gold Cross is encircled by a garland of Marguerites.

The motto on the badge reads:  
**Simple Dans Ma Vertu (Simple in Virtue)  
Forte Dans Mon Devoir ( Steadfast in Duty)**

The Gospel is a guide for those who seek Godâ€™s will for a life of godliness  
The Rosary is the story of the Gospel as seen through the eyes of the Virgin Mary.  
The Distaff and the Spindle are signs of womanly labour and remind us of the satisfaction and fufilment to be found in a task well-accomplished.  
Virtue is nobleness of character as shown in correct behaviour towards God and man.  
To be Steadfast in Duty is to be faithful in fulfilling our obligations
