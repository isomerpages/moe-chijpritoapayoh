Advancing our aims with zeal and might  
Guide us in our studies, O Lord we pray  
Wisdom, courage and charity  
Strengthen in us each daySolidly united in our motto sound  
Simple in virtue, strong in duty bound

Defending and serving our country  
Noble in ambition, thought, word and deed  
Rally round CHIJ, we will strive to succeed

Solidly united in our motto sound
