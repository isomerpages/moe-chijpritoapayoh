<br>Advancing our aims with zeal and might
<br>Guide us in our studies, O Lord we pray
<br>Wisdom, courage and charity

<br>Defending and serving our country
<br>Noble in ambition, thought, word and deed
<br>Rally round CHIJ, we will strive to succeed</p>
<p>Solidly united in our motto sound
<br>Simple in virtue, strong in duty bound</p>
