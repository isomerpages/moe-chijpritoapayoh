<p>Safety and Security Within the School</p>
<p>We would like to remind all parents and caregivers to report to the primary
school’s guard house upon arrival if they wish to meet with their daughter’s
teacher or a school staff. They will be issued a visitor’s pass at the
Guard House. The tag is to be displayed prominently at all times while
they are in the school premises.</p>
<p>If parents or caregivers are waiting to pick up their daughters after
lessons / CCA / supplementary classes, they are to wait at the canteen.
Parents and caregivers are not allowed to enter the classroom blocks for
the safety of our students.</p>
