Safety and Security Within the School

We would like to remind all parents and caregivers to report to the primary school’s guard house upon arrival if they wish to meet with their daughter’s teacher or a school staff. They will be issued a visitor’s pass at the Guard House. The tag is to be displayed prominently at all times while they are in the school premises.

If parents or caregivers are waiting to pick up their daughters after lessons / CCA / supplementary classes, they are to wait at the canteen. Parents and caregivers are not allowed to enter the classroom blocks for the safety of our students.
