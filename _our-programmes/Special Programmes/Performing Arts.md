Our Arts policy is designed to provide opportunities for each student to discover, engage and expand her capacity in the arts, namely in Music, Dance and Visual Art.

To encourage exploration of the performing arts, the school arranges for an array of arts performances for Assembly. Every year, students have opportunities to watch choral, instrumental, dance and drama performances put up by experts in these fields.

To deepen the engagement, our Primary 1 and 2 students are taught movement and dance as part of the Dance Curriculum. At the end of the module, they showcase their learning in the annual Dance Fest. The concert also serves as an identification pool for the Dance CCAs.

The Program for Active Learning (PAL) has a drama module to expose our students to this form of Art. Students have an opportunity to watch and experience a “live” performance at a theatre when they are in Primary 3 as part of the drama exposure programme. Students who are interested in drama can join the Theatre Academy CCA.

The school’s biennial Nuit de Musique concert provides the platform for all the performing arts groups to gather and showcase their hard work and talents. Students who have displayed excellence in other areas of performing arts are also invited to participate in the concert.
