Our Student Leadership Programme is anchored on both the CHRIST values and the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People (7HEP). Formal leadership training and opportunities aligned to the values-centred culture are planned and conducted for student leaders such as the Prefects and members of the Class EXCO. These are structured platforms in which the CHRIST values and 7HEP are explicitly taught.

**1) Prefects’ Investiture**

The annual Prefects’ Investiture is a prestigious ceremony and a milestone event for our prefects where the Prefects’ Executive Committee is installed. Our new Primary 4 prefects who are appointed on a yearly basis, are also introduced to the student population during the Investiture.

**2) Class Executive Committee (EXCO) Installation and Training**

A Class EXCO comprising of 11 members is installed every Semester. The Class EXCO comprises the different subject monitors, led by the class Chairperson and Vice Chairperson. Together, they lead in decision-making with the class bearing the CHRIST values and practising the 7 Habits. During the Class EXCO ceremony, the Class EXCO takes a pledge as a call to serve.

**3) Prefects’ Bake and Craft**

The Prefects pit their leadership and entrepreneurial skills in the annual Bake and Craft sale. The sale serves as a platform for our prefects to exercise their creativity to craft business plans and collaborate with their teammates to sell their products, where the proceeds are donated to the IJ Homes and Children’s Centre.

**4)  Prefects’ Meetings**

During the monthly Prefects’ Meetings, our student leaders learn the value of servant leadership and kickstart projects where they identify problems in the school environment and propose solutions to these issues.
