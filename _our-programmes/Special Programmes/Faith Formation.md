2021 was a very special year for us as we celebrated the 400th year of our Founder, Blessed Nicolas Barre’s birth.

As part of our Founder’s Day Project, students and staff expressed how they had been touched by His call in various ways such as a letter, a poem, a conviction in forms of drawing and writings etc. In addition, the works of thirty-two of our students were selected to be published in a compilation of messages from the 11 IJ schools, the Infant Jesus Homes and Children’s Centre, CHIJ Board of Management and the IJ nuns, “IJ Voices”. We hope you will enjoy reading it as much as we have enjoyed putting it together.

The rest of our students’ expressions were displayed in the classrooms, put up on our school’s TV messaging system and published in our yearbook. Here’s a snippet of their expressions.

Undeterred by the COVID-19 situation, the school had Masses livestreamed via Zoom to the classes. Communion was also distributed during Mass. We worked with the Redemptorists and Diocesan priests to bring this special encounter with Christ to our school community. Our school also shifted the Rosary and Novena sessions online via Zoom so that our students and their families can now join us in prayer.
