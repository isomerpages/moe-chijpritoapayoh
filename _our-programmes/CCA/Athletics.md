<p><strong><u>Overview</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Athletics lays the groundwork for athletic development by focusing on
the core components of speed, endurance, strength, coordination, and agility.
It provides students with essential movement skills that are transferable
to many other sports and physical activities.</p>
<p>Students with potential will have the opportunity to represent the school
in both track (sprints, middle-distance, relays) and field (long jump,
high jump, shot put, etc.) events at inter-school and national competitions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Levels of Participation:</p>
<p><u>Recreational Team (Primary 4 to 6)</u>
</p>
<p>Students interested in learning the basics of athletics may join this
team as a CCA. Emphasis is on developing general fitness, proper technique,
and enjoyment of the sport.</p>
<p><u>Developmental Team</u>
</p>
<p>Lower primary students who demonstrate potential during PE lessons are
invited to join this team. Students receive focused training to build their
foundational skills and they may be selected for the Competitive Team based
on their progress and attitude.</p>
<p><u>Competitive (Junior and Senior) Team</u>
</p>
<p>Students who are physically ready and demonstrate strong potential are
selected to undergo rigorous training. Athletes must show commitment and
discipline to represent the school in official track and field meets.</p>
