The CHIJ Primary (Toa Payoh) Dance Club was established in October 2005 with the aim of developing students’ talents in Dance.  Members are identified through careful observation of their progress and performance throughout the IJ Dance Programme.

In line with the school’s plans of providing a holistic education for our students and developing each child to the best of her potential, the students cultivate a keen interest in the art of dance and they also develop poise, grace, musicality, agility and flexibility. Being a dancer also instils in the students self-discipline and promotes confidence. With much hard work and dedication, the Dance Club members, guided by our talented instructors, have taken the dance arts scene in CHIJ Primary to new heights.
