**A. CCA Policy**

CCA is a platform for the development of character and talents/ interests of students.

*   Primary 4, 5 and 6 students are required to select one CCA and will remain in the same CCA for the complete school year.
*   Students who are members of the Sports Development Squads, Training Squads, School Teams or Performing Arts SYF Groups are expected to remain in the same CCA until Primary 6.
*   Primary 6 students will attend CCA in the first semester. However, they will continue to represent the school in Term 3, if required.
*   Students are to submit a medical certificate or a letter of excuse at the following session if they have missed their weekly CCA.
*   Only students who have attained 80% attendance will have their CCA recorded in their individual CCA report slips.

**B. Exemption from CCA**

Students may be exempted from CCA on the following grounds, subject to the school’s approval:

<u>Medical Reasons</u>

*   The request for exemption due to medical reasons must be supported by a doctor’s recommendation.
*   The doctor’s letter of recommendation is to be submitted to the HOD PE/CCA at the start of each school year.

<u>Regular Participation in External Co-Curricular Activities (not offered by the school)</u><br>
The following requirements must be met:
