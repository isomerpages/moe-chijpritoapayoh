<p><strong><u>Overview</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Netball is a popular sport in CHIJ Primary (Toa Payoh).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through the Netball CCA, students get to further hone their passing and
catching skills which they have learnt in their PE lessons, and develop
new skills such as dodging, pivoting, shooting and defending.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Besides acquiring skills and knowledge, netball also provides an important
platform for our students to develop communication skills and social connections
while promoting our CHRIST values such as courage, humility, resilience,
integrity, steadfastness and thoughtfulness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are different levels of the sport offered:</p>
<p><u>Competitive (Senior and Junior Team)</u>
</p>
<p>Students with a good attitude and who demonstrate good physical abilities
and netball skills will be selected to join the training squad. These students
will train twice every week, in preparation for the various competitions
(for e.g. National School Games, Netball Carnival)</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>P5 and P6 Recreational Team</u>
</p>
<p>Students who are interested in learning more about the fundamental movements
and skills of netball can join the recreation team, which trains once every
week. Students in the netball recreation team are able to develop their
passing and catching skills through fun and modified games.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>P4 Netball Team</u>
</p>
<p>Students in the P4 Netball team train once every week in Semester 1. Students
who show potential in the sport will join the P4 Development squad in Semester
2, which trains twice every week. The P4 development squad will then move
on to the P5 Junior team the following year.</p>
