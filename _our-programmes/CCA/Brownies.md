<p><strong><u>Overview</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Brownies CCA comprises Primary 4 to 6 girls who enjoy learning and
having amazing adventures together!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Brownies are encouraged to explore and discover the world around them
and to become more independent. They are constantly learning new skills
and challenged to try new and adventurous activities that will inspire
them to think about what they want to be and do in the future.</p>
<p>Brownies learn to work and play independently and in teams. On special
occasions, Brownies do fun things together with other Brownie or Girl Guide
units for joint learning adventures.</p>
<p>Activities may include Division Days and Outdoor Cooking. Along the way,
they learn to care for each other and the people around them and make lasting
friendships.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition, Brownies get to work to attain interest badges and awards
which will also help them develop new skills.</p>
<p></p>
