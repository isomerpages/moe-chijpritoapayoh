Brownies are part of the international guiding movement. Students in Brownies are taught life skills that will encourage each girl to be a responsible citizen and to lead a useful life.  Students receive badges when they complete a leadership or a life-skill activity successfully.

Through a combination of games, activities and training, Brownies walk the path to become women of character, becoming women for others and being able to meet life’s challenges with God as their shepherd.

<u>Learning Outcomes :</u>

_Students will be able to …_

*   Explore and learn about the world they live in.
*   Develop self-confidence.
*   Learn to work in teams.
*   Work for interest badges and awards that will help them develop new skills.
