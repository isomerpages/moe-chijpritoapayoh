<p><strong><u>Overview</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our school's Swim CCA is designed to equip students with essential water
confidence and safety skills while fostering a lifelong appreciation for
swimming. Through structured lessons and practice, students will develop
vital water survival abilities, improve their physical fitness, including
strength, endurance, and coordination, and gain proficiency in various
swimming strokes. The programme also focuses on refining techniques, understanding
the rules of the sport, and promoting values such as sportsmanship, excellence,
fair play, teamwork, and discipline. Beyond skill development, it aims
to create an enjoyable and supportive environment that encourages students
to embrace swimming as a lifelong activity.</p>
