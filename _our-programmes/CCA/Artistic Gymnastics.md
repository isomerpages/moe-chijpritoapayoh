<p><strong><u>Overview</u></strong>
</p>
<p>CHIJ Primary (Toa Payoh) is known for her outstanding gymnasts who excel
in Artistic Gymnastics.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Gymnastics provides the foundation blocks in movement experience which
enables the students to apply the fundamentals learnt in other sports.
The sport develops the students in their physical strength, flexibility,
agility, coordination and balance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Competent gymnasts will have opportunities to represent the school in
competitions where they execute short routines on different apparatus,
namely the balance beam, vault, bars and floor.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are different levels of the sport offered:</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Recreational Team (Primary 4 to 6)</u>
</p>
<p>Students who are interested in learning the sport on a recreational basis
can choose to select the sport as their CCA. However, students need to
be physically fit and reasonably flexible to be able to join in the activities.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Developmental Teams</u>
</p>
<p>Lower primary students who show potential in the sport through the school’s
screening and Fun Gym enrichment programme are invited to attend twice
weekly training so that their skills can be honed.&nbsp; They will also
be selected for the Competitive Team if they show potential and commitment.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Competitive (Junior and Senior) Teams</u>
</p>
<p>Students who are physically and mentally ready will be selected to join
the training squad. The gymnasts need to be committed to the sport and
attend a rigorous training programme to represent the school in various
competitions.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Learning Outcomes</u></strong>
</p>
<p>By participating in the Artistic Gymnastics CCA, students will be able
to:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Explain and apply their
knowledge of artistic gymnastics to execute skills safely.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Execute some of the
compulsory routines at the non-competitive level and to complete the entire
