<p><strong>A. CCA Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>CCAs aim to provide students with a holistic education by fostering personal
development, character building and the acquisition of skills. An IJ girl
should strive to discover her interest and talent, develop her character
and values and deepen her sense of belonging to the school and community
by participating in a CCA.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Primary 4, 5 and 6 students are required to select one CCA and will remain
in the same CCA for the duration of the school year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who have been selected as members of the Sports CCA Development
or Competitive Teams or, Performing Arts SYF Groups are expected to remain
in the same CCA until they step down in Primary 6.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Primary 6 students will be expected to attend CCA in the first semester.
However, they will continue to represent the school in Term 3 for competitions
or events, if required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are to submit a medical certificate or letter of excuse to the
CCA teacher-in-charge if they have missed their weekly CCA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only students who have attained 80% attendance will have their CCA recorded
in their individual CCA report slips.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B. Exemption from CCA</strong>

the school’s approval:</p>
<p><u>Medical Reasons</u>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The request for exemption due to medical reasons must be supported by
a doctor’s recommendation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The doctor’s letter of recommendation is to be submitted to the HOD (PE
&amp; CCA) at the start of each school year.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Regular Participation in External Co-Curricular Activities (not offered by the school)</u>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The student concerned must be attending training for the external activity
at least 3 times a week at a relatively intensive level.</p>
</li>
<li>

external activity will need to be submitted to the HOD (PE &amp; CCA) for
documentation purposes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C. Early Recruitment for Selected CCAs</strong>
