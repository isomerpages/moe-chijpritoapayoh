### **<u>Vision</u>**

Learning to be creative and innovative through Mathematics

**Unpacking the vision**

The school would like the IJ girl to be able to:

1.  acquire the necessary mathematical concepts and skills for everyday life,
2.  develop and apply the mathematical thinking and problem-solving skills,
3.  develop positive attitudes towards mathematics,
4.  develop the ability to reason logically, to communicate mathematically, and to learn cooperatively and independently

### **<u>Key Programmes</u>**


**Teaching Approach**

1.  Use of CPA (Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract) in the classroom  
    – with the use of manipulatives to give students the concrete experience
    
    – with emphasis on Learning Experiences for the students
    
2.  Use of Heuristics Package to explicitly teach various problem-solving strategies from P1 to P6
3.  Use of Reasoning and Communication strategies to teach Mathematical reasoning from P3 to P6

**Differentiation**

1.  Differentiated worksheets are used from P3 to P5 as part of daily lessons to meet the different needs of our students
2.  At P4, E2K Math is conducted after school for selected high progress students
3.  High Progress students are selected to take part in competitions such as Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympic (SASMO) and Singapore Math Kangaroo Contest (SMKC).
4.  At P5 and P6, students are stretched through after school workshops.
5.  Low Progress students are given closer attention in smaller classes  
    – Learning Support for Math(LSM) Programme at P1 & P2
    
    – Remedial lessons from P2 to P6
