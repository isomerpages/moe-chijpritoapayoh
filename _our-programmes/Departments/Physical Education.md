### <u>Vision</u>

Empowered IJ girls who are Fit for Learning and Game for Life

### <u>Mission</u>


Inspire IJ girls to love PE, love the outdoors and understand the benefits of play. Empower IJ girls to have a positive attitude towards a healthy lifestyle in order to serve self and others in life.

### <u>Key Programmes</u>


**Motto**  
Every Child Learns and Plays with Joy; All are Winners

**Approach**  
The Progressive PE & Sports Curriculum : 3E Framework  
Explore — > Engage — > Excel (Empowered to Venture)

Students will progress from exploring opportunities to experience a wide array of sporting activities to being engaged & eventually excelling in areas of their interest and strengths. In pursuing excellence, IJ girls will learn perseverance through hard work and determination and come away with a greater sense of school spirit and community.

It is the school’s aim to empower all students to take ownership of their learning, lead a healthy lifestyle and contribute to the community by taking responsibility of their own learning and serving others in the process.

**IJ Venture Programme**

The IJ Venture Programme is an extension of the LLP (Learning for Life Programme) endorsed by MOE in 2017. The IJ Venture Programme within the curriculum is crucial in providing authentic learning experiences in the outdoors and promoting school-wide opportunities for IJ girls in multi-sports with particular emphasis on gymnastics and athletics for good foundation in fundamental movement skills. It is envisioned that the students will learn and apply the desired skills and values. This process will have a strong character education aspect with a mindset for excellence – the attributes needed for them to be future-ready and able to meet life’s challenges, as defined in the school’s vision.

The IJ Venture Programme rides on the PE and Outdoor Education curriculum with a focus on progressive development which caters to the masses but will also serve as a platform to identify students with potential for exposure to competitions at higher levels. The various school based programmes and activities will serve as a platform for IJ girls to experience competition and demonstrate the values learnt. By the end of 6 years, the IJ girl would:

1.  Experience a progressive multi-sports skills development programme,
2.  Be able to execute basic gymnastics & dance routines; excel in athletics; swim safe and play Netball, Tennis, Soccer, T-ball, Basketball competently,
3.   Acquire the values and attitudes to be future-ready and better able to meet life’s challenges.
