<h3><u>Vision</u></h3>
<p>Nurturing a Committed and Virtuous Citizen</p>
<h3><u>Mission</u></h3>
<p>Every child matters at CHIJ Primary (Toa Payoh). Through our Character
and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum, we aim to inculcate values
and build social and emotional competencies in our students. The meaningful
learning experiences that are planned serve as a channel through which
the CCE Department helps every child realise her true potential as a woman
of virtue, committed to the service of community, nation and beyond.</p>
