### **<u>Vision</u>**

At CHIJ Primary (Toa Payoh), we believe the arts has intrinsic value in our lives as it plays a vital role in sparking imagination and providing opportunities for emotional development. 

The CHIJ Aesthetics Curriculum aims to nurture our students to
*   have a lively and inquisitive mind 
*   express themselves confidently through the different arts forms
*   appreciate and make meaning of lives, culture and heritage
*   adopt a life-long appreciation and engagement in the arts

### **<u>Aesthetics Curriculum</u>**
### **<u>Art</u>**
Drawing is a core component of our Visual Art curriculum, but students also explore a wide range of media and styles across levels to develop their creativity and appreciation for the arts.

At each level, students experience unique art forms:

*	Primary 1:  Drawing, oil pastelling, and plasticine art to build fine motor skills and learn basic colour theory.
*	Primary 2:  Introduction to painting with emphasis on water-to-paint control.
*	Primary 3:  Exploring traditional performances such as *Wayang Kulit*.
*	Primary 4:  Diorama making using paper craft and Museum-Based Learning.
*	Primary 5:  Ceramics and still life drawing.
*	Primary 6:  Chinese ink painting in contrast with Western painting styles.

Students also present their artworks through school exhibitions and take part in art competitions, offering valuable platforms to build confidence and celebrate their artistic growth.

### **<u>Music</u>**
Music develops students in their socio-emotional skills by being actively involved in the process of music making individually and as a group. They are critical thinkers who seek to understand, appreciate music through analyzing and evaluating musical observations and experiences
