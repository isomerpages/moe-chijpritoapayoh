### **<u>Vision</u>**

Nurturing scientific thinkers with inquiring minds

At CHIJ Primary (Toa Payoh), the Science Department seeks to create a vibrant learning environment to instill a spirit of inquiry in our students and to develop them into scientific thinkers who will passionately apply the scientific knowledge to enrich life.

### **<u>Key Programmes</u>**

At CHIJ Primary (Toa Payoh), we strongly believe that students learn best when they are engaged in authentic activities and projects that they can relate to. Besides developing their inquiry skills, we also want our students to acquire the right ethics and attitudes in the learning of Science.

Primary 3- Growing mushrooms and Super Vehicle Programme  
Primary 4- Pet mealworms and Pocket Beanies Programme  
Primary 5- Fun with electricity  
Primary 6- Understanding forces and energy using toys

Our students also participate in school wide-Environment programmes such as World Water Day and Celebrating Earth Hour
